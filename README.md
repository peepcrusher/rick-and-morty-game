###Homework for Unit 3
This homework assignment was to create a game where there was a randomly generated target value,that you were supposed to reach using buttons that were assigned a random value. 

####Process
First I needed to give the HTML some structure. I created some HTML elements that corresponded to what they would ultimately represent and gave them appropriate ID's.

In the javascript I had to create variables to keep track of wins, losses, the target score, your score, and each of the buttons that will add to your score.

I created a reset function to be used after every win or loss to reset all the necessary values to 0, and randomize all the variables for buttons and target score. 

made if/else statements to determine whether or not the user won or lost the game, then adjust the wins/losses appropriately then call the reset function.

after the logic was done I styled it with Bootstrap.

I put everything in a container and specified rows and collumns to make everything look nice and even.
